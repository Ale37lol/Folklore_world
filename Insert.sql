The pharaoh, a god on earth and guarantor of cosmic order (Ma\'at), mediated between the divine and the human. In centers like Thebes and Memphis, majestic temples arose as microcosms of the universe where daily rituals ensured victory over entropy (Isfet).

The imperial cult deified political power, while mysterious oriental cults (like those of Mithras or the Magna Mater) promised personal salvation, traversing the borders of a cosmopolitan empire. Monuments like the Pantheon (temple to "all the gods") and celebrations like the Ludi Saeculares embodied a religious syncretism functional to governance.

The sudden death of Lord Carnarvon from an infected mosquito bite in 1923, coinciding with a mysterious power outage in Cairo, ignited global hysteria. Newspapers attributed subsequent deaths of expedition members—like archaeologist Arthur Mace and financier George Jay Gould—to the curse, often citing an inscription: "Death shall come on swift wings to him who disturbs the peace of the King."

The wax melted, the feathers scattered, and Icarus plummeted into the sea below, which now bears his name (the Icarian Sea). Daedalus, heartbroken, flew on to Sicily.

While usually invisible, a glimpse of her combing her hair is a bad omen; to pick up the comb she drops is to incur her wrath.

Daji encouraged horrific cruelty, extravagant debauchery, and the torture and execution of loyal ministers. Her influence drained the dynasty\'s virtue (de), leading to its overthrow by the Zhou.
